Please place logs either in a code block (press M in your browser for a GFM cheat sheet) or a gist.

#Suggesting Features

If it has not been suggested, create a new issue with at least the following information:

a short, descriptive title;
a detailed description of the suggestion and
any resources which may assist with the suggestion

#Conduct
There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions. While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

* Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
* Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
* Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
* Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.
Remember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with Steam. As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested. Patience is always appreciated.
